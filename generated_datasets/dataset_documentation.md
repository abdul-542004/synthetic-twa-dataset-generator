# Enhanced TWA Dataset Documentation

## Dataset Overview

**Dataset Name**: Enhanced Synthetic US Wellness & Aging Dataset  
**Generation Date**: 2025-09-24 01:58:29  
**Version**: 1.0  
**Total Subjects**: 1,000  
**Total Observations**: 12,000  
**Time Period**: 12 months  
**Variables**: 66

## Purpose and Scope

This dataset was created to support research into Tiny Wellness Activities (TWAs) and their impact on aging and wellness outcomes. It integrates:

- **5 Do More Activities**: Motion, Sleep, Hydration, Diet Quality, Meditation
- **5 Do Less Activities**: Smoking, Excessive Alcohol, Added Sugars, Excess Sodium, Ultra-processed Foods  
- **Connection & Purpose**: Social Networks, Nature Connection, Cultural Engagement, Life Purpose

The dataset maintains research-validated correlations and effect sizes from longevity studies, Blue Zone research, and intervention trials.

## Scientific Foundation

### Research Sources
- Expert consensus biomarkers of aging
- Blue Zone lifestyle research  
- Mediterranean diet intervention studies
- Exercise and biological age research
- Social connection and mortality studies
- Purpose/meaning and longevity research

### Key Effect Sizes Implemented
- **Exercise**: -1.2 years biological age for regular exercisers
- **Mediterranean Diet**: -2.3 years biological age for high adherence
- **Purpose**: 40% mortality risk reduction (HR=0.60)
- **Social Connection**: 50% mortality risk reduction for well-connected individuals
- **Smoking**: +5.3 years biological age acceleration

## Dataset Structure

### Longitudinal Design
- **Baseline**: Month 0 demographics and initial measures
- **Follow-up**: Monthly assessments for 12 months
- **Seasonal Effects**: Behavioral variations by season (Winter, Spring, Summer, Fall)
- **Life Events**: Realistic life event impacts on behaviors and outcomes

### Variable Categories

#### Demographics (Time-Invariant)
- Age, Gender, Ethnicity, Education, Income
- Geographic region, Urban/Rural status
- Occupation, Marital status, Household size

#### TWA Behaviors (Monthly)
- **Do More**: Motion days/week, Sleep hours/quality, Hydration, Diet quality, Meditation minutes
- **Do Less**: Smoking status, Alcohol consumption, Sugar/Sodium intake, Processed foods
- **Connection & Purpose**: Social connections, Nature time, Cultural activities, Life purpose

#### Wellness & Aging Outcomes (Monthly)
- **Biological Age**: Acceleration/deceleration relative to chronological age
- **Biomarkers**: CRP, IL-6, IGF-1, GDF-15, Cortisol (expert consensus validated)
- **Functional**: Grip strength, Gait speed, Balance, Frailty index
- **Cognitive**: Composite score, Processing speed
- **Psychosocial**: Life satisfaction, Stress, Depression risk, Social support

#### Composite Scores
- **Healthy Aging Profile**: Research-weighted composite of behaviors and outcomes
- **Blue Zone Similarity**: Lifestyle similarity to longevity populations

## Data Quality and Validation

### Demographic Accuracy
- US Census 2023 age, education, income distributions
- Regional and urban/rural patterns
- Occupation and household characteristics

### Behavioral Realism  
- CDC health behavior prevalence rates
- Seasonal variation patterns
- Behavioral consistency and change over time
- Life event impacts

### Outcome Validity
- Research-validated effect sizes
- Biomarker reference ranges
- Functional measure age-related changes

### Validation Results
- **Overall Quality**: POOR
- **Excellent Validations**: 6.7%
- **Good Validations**: 0.0%
- **Total Validations Performed**: 30

## Usage Guidelines

### Research Applications
1. **TWA Impact Modeling**: Quantify lifestyle intervention effects on aging
2. **Personalized Health Planning**: Individual risk/benefit analysis
3. **Population Health Studies**: Demographic patterns in healthy aging
4. **Intervention Design**: Optimize multi-component wellness programs
5. **Biomarker Research**: Explore aging indicator relationships

### Statistical Considerations
- **Longitudinal Structure**: Account for within-subject correlation
- **Missing Data**: Minimal missing data by design
- **Outliers**: Realistic extreme values included
- **Sample Size**: Adequate power for most analyses

### Limitations
- **Synthetic Data**: Not suitable for FDA submissions or clinical guidelines
- **US Population**: Demographic patterns specific to United States
- **Time Period**: Cross-sectional snapshot of 2024 health patterns
- **Causality**: Correlational relationships, not experimental evidence
