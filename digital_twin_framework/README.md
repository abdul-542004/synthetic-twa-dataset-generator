# Digital Twin Framework for Personalized Wellness Optimization

A complete system that transforms synthetic TWA (Tiny Wellness Activities) datasets into deployment-ready personalized wellness optimization platforms.

## 🎯 Overview

This framework creates individual digital twins that learn from a person's demographics and actual activities to continuously optimize their wellness journey with evidence-based interventions.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Installation

```python
# Add the parent directory to your Python path
import sys
sys.path.append('/path/to/dataset-generator')

# Import core components
from digital_twin_framework.core import (
    PersonalDigitalTwin,
    DigitalTwinOrchestrator, 
    InterventionPlanner,
    ProgressMonitor
)
```

### Interactive App

For an interactive demonstration and simulation:

1. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Run the Streamlit app:**
   ```bash
   python run_app.py
   ```
   Or directly:
   ```bash
   streamlit run streamlit_app.py
   ```

3. **Open your browser** to explore the interactive digital twin simulator!

### Basic Usage

```python
# 1. Create a digital twin
demographics = {
    'age_numeric': 35,
    'gender': 'Female',
    'education': 'Bachelor+', 
    'income_bracket': '$75-100k',
    'ethnicity': 'White',
    'urban_rural': 'Urban',
    'region': 'Northeast'
}

current_behaviors = {
    'motion_days_week': 2,
    'diet_mediterranean_score': 5.0,
    'meditation_minutes_week': 10,
    'sleep_hours': 7.0,
    'alcohol_drinks_week': 4.0,
    'social_connections_count': 4
}

twin = PersonalDigitalTwin(
    person_id='user_001',
    demographics=demographics,
    initial_behaviors=current_behaviors
)

# 2. Optimize activities for wellness goals
wellness_goals = {
    'biological_age_acceleration': -1.0,
    'life_satisfaction_score': 8.0
}

optimization_result = twin.optimize_activities(wellness_goals)

# 3. Create intervention plan
planner = InterventionPlanner()
intervention_plan = planner.create_intervention_plan(
    person_id='user_001',
    digital_twin_optimization=optimization_result,
    duration_weeks=12
)

# 4. Monitor progress and adapt
monitor = ProgressMonitor('user_001', intervention_plan.__dict__)

# Record progress
monitor.record_progress(
    metrics={'energy_level': 7, 'mood_rating': 8},
    compliance_rate=0.85
)
```

## 🔧 Core Components
